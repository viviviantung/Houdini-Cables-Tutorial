# Houdini-Cables-Tutorial

The technology I am going to learn about is the Houdini software. I want to learn about this software because if one is able to get past the learning curve and get more familiar with what the software can do, one will be able to create useful and interesting tools that procedurally models geometry. Also, this software is central to our final project, and the tool I created in this tutorial is one that we will try to merge into our project.

I am going to follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iOGo_xFymw&ab_channel=SimonHoudini
